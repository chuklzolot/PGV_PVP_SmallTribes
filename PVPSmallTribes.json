You may not create a secondary character for the purpose of exploiting the in-game accountability systems.\nDo not block artifacts, obelisks, crate spawns or high-value resource spawns (metal, obsidian, etc).\nWhen looting beaver dams, clear everything, including the wood, out of the dam so it will respawn.\nNo long-term harassment or imprisonment. Players must be released after no more than 1 hour. All prisoners must released before you log off.\nTribe names can only be changed once every 2 weeks.\nRepeatedly raiding the same tribe in a short period of time (1-3 days) will be considered griefing, action may be taken by the admins if this occurs.\nNo insiding - Do not disable defenses, unclaim tames, or destroy builds before leaving </>",
